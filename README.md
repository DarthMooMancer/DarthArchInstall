# DarthArchInstall
An Arch Install Script to run after a minimal install with my custom i3wm script

Clone this repo after a minimal install and run the install.sh by using (./install.sh)

This distro uses awesome fonts for icons and not nerd fonts. If you have the knowledge to change it for yourself, go ahead but not recommended. 

Applications Menu Warning:
========================================
If you install any applications, you have to manually add them to rofi applications menu (it's simple)

* The most popular apps used are there but if you need to add an app such as steam you will have to add it manually.
